Analysis Description

1. **Data Loading and Exploration:**
   - **Objective:** Load the Spotify dataset and understand its structure.
   - **Process:** Utilize Pandas to read the data from a CSV file and inspect basic information such as columns, data types, and missing values.

2. **Feature Engineering:**
   - **Objective:** Prepare the dataset by encoding categorical features.
   - **Process:** Use label encoding to transform categorical columns like 'track_id', 'track_name', etc., making them suitable for machine learning algorithms.

3. **Outlier Detection and Handling:**
   - **Objective:** Identify and address outliers in the dataset.
   - **Process:** Apply the Interquartile Range (IQR) method to detect outliers and replace them with appropriate values to ensure the robustness of the clustering algorithm.


 4. **Scatter plot of track_popularity and danceability**
    - A scatter plot is a visual representation of data points in a two-dimensional space. Each point on the plot corresponds to specific values of two variables, with the x and y coordinates representing those values. Scatter plots help explore relationships between variables, identify trends, clusters, or outliers, and are useful for visualizing patterns in data. They typically include axes, markers, labels, and other elements to enhance interpretation.

5. **2D Clustering (track_popularity and danceability):**
   - **Objective:** Explore clusters in a 2D space using two features.
   - **Process:** Standardize selected features using StandardScaler and perform k-means clustering. Visualize the clusters in a 2D scatter plot.

   
6. **Elbow Method:**
   - **Objective:** Determine the optimal number of clusters (k) for different scenarios.
   - **Process:** Employ the Elbow Method by running k-means with varying values of k and observing the change in Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS).

7. **2d clustering plt.scatter df['track_popularity'],y = df['danceability'],c= prediction,cmap = 'rainbow'**
   - ![fig 3](https://github.com/Shubhangi-6/Spotify-Data-Analysis/assets/140615568/d747452c-b8df-428e-87fb-61fb1371b95e)
   - This figure is a scatter plot where each point represents a music track from the Spotify dataset. The x-axis shows the standardized values of 'track_popularity,' and the y-axis shows the standardized values of 'danceability.' The points are color-coded based on the clusters assigned by the k-means algorithm, with different colors indicating different clusters. The 'rainbow' colormap is used for visual distinction. This plot allows for the visualization of how tracks are grouped or clustered based on their popularity and danceability characteristics.

8. **Clustering of Energy and Loudness**
   - ![fig 4](https://github.com/Shubhangi-6/Spotify-Data-Analysis/assets/140615568/57d8b36b-4459-4083-930d-ab96c63d2ecb)
   - The code snippet suggests clustering based on 'energy' and 'loudness' features from the Spotify dataset:

- **Variables:**
  - x-axis: 'energy'
  - y-axis: 'loudness'

- **Visualization:**
  - A scatter plot displays tracks, with x representing energy and y representing loudness.

- **Clustering:**
  - Apply k-means clustering to group tracks.
  - Determine the optimal cluster count using the elbow method.

- **Result:**
  - Visualize clustered tracks in the scatter plot with distinct colors for each cluster.


8. **Clustering Scenarios:**
   - **Objective:** Explore clustering with different feature pairs.
   - **Process:** Perform k-means clustering on three pairs of features: ('track_popularity' and 'danceability'), ('energy' and 'loudness'), and ('track_artist' and 'track_name'). Visualize the clusters for each scenario.
  

     
9. **Cluster Labeling:**
   - **Objective:** Add cluster labels to the original dataset.
   - **Process:** Assign cluster labels obtained from k-means clustering to the original DataFrame for further analysis.
     

10. **Inertia and Silhouette Score:**
   - **Objective:** Evaluate the performance of the clustering algorithm.
   - **Process:** Calculate inertia (within-cluster sum of squares) and silhouette score to assess the quality of the clusters.
     

11. **3D Scatter Plot with Plotly:**
   - **Objective:** Visualize clusters in a three-dimensional space.
   - **Process:** Use Plotly to create an interactive 3D scatter plot, incorporating 'track_artist', 'track_name', and 'track_popularity' as axes.
     

12. **Results and Insights:**
    - **Objective:** Summarize findings and draw insights from the clustering results.
    - **Process:** Identify distinct clusters, understand relationships between features, and assess the overall success of the clustering.


13. **Next Steps:**
    - **Objective:** Suggest potential future actions based on the analysis.
    - **Process:** Propose further analyses or applications of the clustering results, such as personalized music recommendations or genre categorization.

13. **Note:**
    - **Objective:** Provide additional information about the project.
    - **Content:** Explain the methodology and tools used, emphasizing the application of unsupervised machine learning (K-Means) to uncover patterns in Spotify music data. Highlight the interactive 3D scatter plot as a visual representation of the clustered data.
